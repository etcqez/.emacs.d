;; The `embark' package lets you target the thing or context at point
;; and select an action to perform on it.  Use the `embark-act'
;; command while over something to find relevant commands.
;;
;; When inside the minibuffer, `embark' can collect/export the
;; contents to a fully fledged Emacs buffer.  The `embark-collect'
;; command retains the original behaviour of the minibuffer, meaning
;; that if you navigate over the candidate at hit RET, it will do what
;; the minibuffer would have done.  In contrast, the `embark-export'
;; command reads the metadata to figure out what category this is and
;; places them in a buffer whose major mode is specialised for that
;; type of content.  For example, when we are completing against
;; files, the export will take us to a `dired-mode' buffer; when we
;; preview the results of a grep, the export will put us in a
;; `grep-mode' buffer.
