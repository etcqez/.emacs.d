;; The `vertico' package applies a vertical layout to the minibuffer.
;; It also pops up the minibuffer eagerly so we can see the available
;; options without further interactions.  This package is very fast
;; and "just works", though it also is highly customisable in case we
;; need to modify its behaviour.

;; The `marginalia' package provides helpful annotations next to
;; completion candidates in the minibuffer.  The information on
;; display depends on the type of content.  If it is about files, it
;; shows file permissions and the last modified date.  If it is a
;; buffer, it shows the buffer's size, major mode, and the like.

;; The `orderless' package lets the minibuffer use an out-of-order
;; pattern matching algorithm.  It matches space-separated words or
;; regular expressions in any order.  In its simplest form, something
;; like "ins pac" matches `package-menu-mark-install' as well as
;; `package-install'.  This is a powerful tool because we no longer
;; need to remember exactly how something is named.
;;
;; Note that Emacs has lots of "completion styles" (pattern matching
;; algorithms), but let us keep things simple.

;; The `consult' package provides lots of commands that are enhanced
;; variants of basic, built-in functionality.  One of the headline
;; features of `consult' is its preview facility, where it shows in
;; another Emacs window the context of what is currently matched in
;; the minibuffer.  Here I define key bindings for some commands you
;; may find useful.  The mnemonic for their prefix is "alternative
;; search" (as opposed to the basic C-s or C-r keys).
